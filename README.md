# Cost Optimization of Metro Transportation Network Construction in Cities Skylines Using a Travelling Salesman Problem Approach
> Tugas Makalah IF1220 Matematika Diskrit

Cities Skylines is a city-building simulation game that allows players to manage all aspects of urban development and city management. To create a successful city, an efficient and widely accessible public transportation network is one of the key factors. One of the most commonly built public transportation systems in Cities Skylines is the Metro, due to its numerous advantages. However, constructing a Metro network requires significant costs, so players must plan the Metro routes with minimal expenses to achieve faster development without compromising other aspects of city management. This problem can be modeled using the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) approach, which is part of graph theory. By applying the Branch and Bound algorithm, the Metro network planning can be solved by finding the most optimal route that covers all stations with the minimum construction cost.
